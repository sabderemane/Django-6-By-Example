# Django-6-By-Example

This is the code repository for Django 6 by Example, written by [Antonio Melé](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Django-5-By-Example/tree/main#:~:text=%2C%20written%20by-,Antonio%20Mel%C3%A9,-and%20published%20by) and published by [Packt](). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.


## Instructions
The code is organised into directories with the chapter number. For example, `Chapter02` contains the source code for chapter 2. 

After cloning the project, you can go to the first chapter with the following command:
```sh
cd Chapter01
```
Next, you can create and activate a virtual environment, install packages using python venv module and pip or uv.

With python venv module with pip:
```sh
python3.12 -m venv my_env
```

with uv:
```sh
uv venv my_env
```
You can get more information about uv in the first chapter of the book. Next, you can activate your environment with the following command:
```sh
source my_env/bin/activate
```
Each chapter folder has a requirements.txt file and a uv.lock file that includes all packages required to run the code of that chapter. These can be installed with the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `uv sync` if you use uv.

Finally, you can install the packages and go to the project folder with the commands below:

with python venv module with pip:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd mysite
```

with uv:
```sh
uv sync
cd mysite
```

Run the Django development server with the command:

```sh
python manage.py runserver
```

Fixtures has been created in order to ease the data creation for some chapters. To use them, you need to make sure you have applied the migrations and created a super user with the "admin" username. You can add them with the `loaddata` command with the path of the filename of the fixture. For example, to load data for the chapter 1:
```sh
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/chapter_1.json
```

Docker Compose is explained in Chapter 17. However all chapters include a Docker Compose configuration and a management script (contribution by [@marksweb](https://github.com/marksweb)).

Commands to build and run using Docker Compose:
```sh
./do.sh build
./do.sh start
```

List of commands:
- `build [<arg>]`: Builds Docker images. Optional arguments can specify specific images to build.
- `exec [<arg>]`: Execute a command in a container.
- `compose`: Minimal wrapper around Docker Compose, ensuring correct configuration files are loaded.
- `migrate [<arg>]`: Apply any unapplied Django migrations.
- `makemigrations [<arg>]`: Create a new Django migration, specifying additional arguments if needed.
- `check`: Validate Django settings.
- `shell`: Open a bash terminal in the specified container (web_run).
- `start [<arg>]`: Start the Django server and dependent services. Use -d to run detached.
- `stop [<arg>]`: Stop the Django server and dependent services.
